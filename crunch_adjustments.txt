Cannot trust the "companies" filter for /organizations query. Zymergen does not come back in request when organization_type is set to company, but in the organization details, zymergen's primary role is listed as a company.

curl "https://api.crunchbase.com/v/3/organizations?user_key={api_key}&query=zymergen&organization_types=company"
vs.
curl "https://api.crunchbase.com/v/3/organizations?user_key={api_key}&query=zymergen"

Gradient Ventures is not searchable through web interface. It does show up in the API.
It does not have any tags for ML / AI.

curl "https://api.crunchbase.com/v/3/organizations?user_key={api_key}&query=Gradient%20Ventures"
vs.
curl "https://api.crunchbase.com/v/3/organizations?user_key={api_key}&query=Gradient%20Ventures&organization_types=investor"
if investor organization_type used, gradient ventures will not show up
